# Overview

This is a simple Java based weather app. It has a user friendly UI, and takes user input for location, and displays the weather condition, temperature, and wind speed at the provided location.

I created this software to help me dive into Java. I had a little bit of experience with Java, but making this program forced me to learn about using API's and really get a lot deeper into the functionality of Java.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
